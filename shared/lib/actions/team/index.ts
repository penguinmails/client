/**
 * Team module - Main exports and orchestration
 *
 * This module provides the main entry point for team-related actions,
 * orchestrating between members, invitations, permissions, and activity logging.
 *
 * NOTE: This file has been converted to a regular export file because
 * Next.js 15 "use server" files can only export async functions.
 * All actual server actions are in the respective module files.
