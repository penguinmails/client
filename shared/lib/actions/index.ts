/**
 * Actions Module - Main Entry Point
 * 
 * This is the main barrel export file for all action modules.
 * It provides clean import paths and maintains backward compatibility
 * while encouraging migration to the new modular structure.
 * 
 * ## Documentation
 * 
 * - **Migration Guide**: See `ACTIONS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive migration documentation
 * - **API Documentation**: See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed API reference
 * - **Migration Examples**: See `MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md` for practical migration examples
 * - **Best Practices**: See `BEST_PRACTICES.md` for coding standards and patterns
 * 
 * ## Quick Start
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import { getBillingInfo } from "@/shared/lib/actions/billing";
 * import { getCampaignAnalytics } from "@/shared/lib/actions/analytics";
 * import { createTeamMember } from "@/shared/lib/actions/team";
 * 
 * // All actions return ActionResult<T>
 * const result = await getBillingInfo();
 * if (result.success) {
 *   console.log("Billing info:", result.data);
 * } else {
 *   console.error("Error:", result.error.message);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Module Structure
 * 
 * - `core/` - Core utilities (types, errors, auth, validation)
 * - `analytics/` - Analytics operations (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `billing/` - Billing and subscription management (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `team/` - Team member and invitation management (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `settings/` - Application settings (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `notifications/` - Notification system (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `templates/` - Template management (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `campaigns/` - Campaign operations (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `domains/` - Domain management (✅ COMPLETED)
 * - `legacy/` - Deprecated actions (for backward compatibility)
