/**
 * Types for LeadAnalyticsService
 * 
 * This module contains all type definitions specific to lead analytics,
 * including interfaces for metrics, analytics results, and local types for
 * Convex responses, update payloads, and return types for analytics methods.
 * All types extend or compose core analytics types from @/types/analytics/core.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Import specific interfaces for method parameters/returns
 * - Types ensure consistency with BaseAnalyticsService and Convex schemas
 * - All numeric metrics use number type (no unions or optionals unless specified)
 * - JSDoc provides detailed descriptions for each property and usage context
