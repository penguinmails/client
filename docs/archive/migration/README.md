# FSD Migration Archive

This directory contains all documentation related to the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) migration process that was completed for the PenguinMails project. These documents are preserved for historical reference and should not be used for current development.

## Migration Context

The FSD migration was a comprehensive architectural refactoring that:

- Reorganized the codebase according to Feature-Sliced Design principles
- Migrated components from a mixed structure to feature-based organization
- Established clear import path conventions and linting rules
- Resolved architectural violations and improved code maintainability
