# Temporary Fixes Archive

This directory is reserved for temporary fixes, workarounds, and outdated implementation guides that are no longer relevant but may be referenced for historical context.

## Purpose

The temporary archive serves as a holding area for:

- Quick fixes that were implemented as temporary solutions
- Workarounds for issues that have since been properly resolved
- Outdated implementation guides that have been superseded
- Documentation for features or approaches that were later deprecated

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to this archive when:

- A temporary fix has been replaced with a permanent solution
- Implementation approaches have been superseded by better practices
- Features have been deprecated or removed
- Documentation becomes outdated due to architectural changes

## Current Status

📁 **EMPTY** - This directory is currently empty but ready to receive temporary documentation as needed.

## Guidelines for Adding Content

When adding content to this archive:

1. **Add context**: Include a brief note about why the content was archived
2. **Reference replacement**: If applicable, link to the current documentation that replaces the archived content
3. **Date stamp**: Include the date when the content was archived
4. **Maintain structure**: Preserve the original file structure when possible
